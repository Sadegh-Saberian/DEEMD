## Drug Repurposing Efficacy Estimation based on Morphological Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Infected Cells within a Multiple Instance Learning Framework

Considering the current COVID-19 global pandemic situation, there is an urgent demand to identify effective compounds that can be used against the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The FDA-approval of a novel compound or a vaccine would take several years. Drug repurposing focuses on identifying other therapeutic applications for already existing clinically approved treatments. It has been a major focus of the research community since it can accelerate the procedure of identifying effective compounds against SARS-CoV-2. Potentially effective compounds can be identified through the analysis of infected cell morphology. In this work we present a computational pipeline based on morphological analysis using deep neural network models in a multiple instance learning framework. The pipeline is capable of estimating the efficacy of a treatment against SARS-CoV-2 based on morphological profiles. The model is also able to localize the infection region without requiring any annotations due to its specific training procedure. The identified treatments are supported by other studies, which adds to the validity of our proposed pipeline.
